# coding_challange_towa
Demo project which was developed as part of an application process for a summer internship at TOWA in Vienna. I used a previous Vue.js demo project called task_manager (the project can be found in a repository with the same name on my page) as a starting point for this project, and implemented the requirements on top of that.

## The application itself
The application was developed using Vue.js and it displays characters from the TV show Breaking Bad. The data is retrieved from the following API: https://breakingbadapi.com/documentation.   
The application consists of a Header and a Footer, as well as two different views: a home-page and a details-page. The home-page is the default page; the details-page is displayed after clicking on an individual character. The home-page view is responsive, which means that it displays either one, two or three columns, depending on the screen size.

## Starting the project
I did not build the project, I just used the development build - use _npm run serve_ to start the application
